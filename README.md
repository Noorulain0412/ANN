This model is used to predict the peak values of lightning-induced over-voltages (LIOVs) considering various influential parameters such as ground resistivity, ground permittivity, return stroke velocity, return stroke peak current, front time, and distance of the lightning channel from overhead line. The peak LIVs will be predicted for the first stroke, and the subsequent strokes using trapezoidal function and modified transmission line with linear current decay (MTLL) model. The MATLAB Simulink files have been placed in separate folders for both: first and the subsequent strokes.
